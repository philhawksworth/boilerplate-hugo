# Boilerplate Hugo project

A good starting point for my Hugo site builds.

This porject is intended to be forked to form the basis of Hugo sites and includes:

- Hugo site with a single, simple theme
- Sass pipeline with CSS cachebusting
- Gulp tasks to generate deployable site


This site is a static web site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It uses a custom Hugo theme (`simple-starter`) built specifically to be a simple starting point to evolve from.


### Project bootstrapping

To build this site you should first checkout this git repository, and then ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node and NPM ](https://nodejs.org)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

With these prerequisites installed, you can install all other dependencies with:

`npm install`

Since Hugo does not currently include a pipeline for compiling Sass into CSS, a Gulp task performs that action. You can start a watcher tasks to automatically compile all Sass into versioned CSS assets by running `gulp`.

While developing, you can also have Hugo automatically recompile the site whenever changes are detected by running `hugo serve`. This will also serve the site on a local web server for testing.

The build task while outputs as deployable site asset is `gulp build`. This is the task triggered automatically on the Netlify hosting environment.


### Deployment

Code and content deployments are performed via git commits to this repository. Any commit pushes to the `master` branch of this repository will trigger an automatic build and deployment by Netlify.

Builds typically take a few seconds and updates should udually be visible in the live site within a minute of majing the change.



## Hosting

The live site is suitable to be hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) as a static web site.

Feature branches can be deployed on Netlify for testing. Any git branch pushed to this repository will become available for testing at `https://{BRANCH-NAME}--{PROJECT-NAME}.netlify.com`
